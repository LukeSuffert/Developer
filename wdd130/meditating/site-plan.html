        Quiet Guide is a website focused on directing young adults to a more balanced and relaxing lifestyle.
         This website answers the question: “What can I do to find peace right now?”
          It will serve as a valuable source to learn meditation techniques, to understand the importance of a lifestyle with mental health awareness, and to go back to in order to find the right action according to one’s situation. 
          The Quiet Guide will not only provide information, but simple and accessible step-by-step instructions and suggestions on how to apply them in day-to-day situations.  

The Home Page should introduce the website’s goals and instructions about the two other pages and in what situation they would be useful to access. Don’t let anxiety win.
 Learn how to prevent minor stressful situations and understand if it is recommended to look for professional help with simple pondering questions. 
 If you find the tips helpful, but insufficient, it is highly recommended to look for professional help. Don’t be afraid to let loved ones get involved in your relaxing exercises or present them with what you learn here to help them.

      <h3>Just Breathe</h3>
      <p>Just Breathe: This page is a quick and practical guide for relaxing breathing exercises.
         Are you feeling anxious right now and would like help to calm down? Remember, it is okay to express your feelings in healthy ways. 
         If you need help with that, please take a look at Quiet Resources. Would you like to read the guide to prevent future situations? 
         Then this is the right page for you. Exercise #1: This breathing exercise for anxiety can be done lying down, sitting, or standing. 
         To begin, slowly and deeply inhale through your nose, keeping your shoulders relaxed. Your abdomen should expand, and your chest should rise slightly.
          Next, exhale slowly through your mouth. As you exhale, purse your lips slightly while keeping your jaw relaxed. You might hear a soft sound as you breathe out. 
          Repeat this technique for several minutes. The exercise was shared by Sheryl Ankrom, a master's in counseling psychology, who also offered a few important cautions: "If you find this exercise difficult, or if it makes you feel more anxious or panicky, stop immediately.
           Sometimes, people with panic disorder may experience increased anxiety when practicing this technique. This could be due to the discomfort of focusing on your breath or the frustration of not getting it quite right without practice. If this happens to you, stop and try again in a day or two, or slowly build up the time you spend doing the exercise,” Ankrom advised. </p>

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        Quiet Resources: The small and simple things we do shape our capacity to handle the big and what seems to be complicated issues in our lives.
         Have a mantra! For example, “I am safe, this feeling is temporary.” Make sure you have a memorized breathing exercise, see more in “Just Breathe.” 
         Keeping a journal is a great habit that helps to put feelings into words. You could use it to describe your day, the feelings you had through it, things that went well, or to define what could be making you have negative feelings. 

If your anxiety is related to screen time, save yourself some time every day to stay away from any devices. This could be even used as a time in contact with the outside world like having a quiet walk, or yoga.  

Music can also help us manage our feelings. Websites like YouTube are full of low-fi beats to relax and study that can be useful. Or at least a relaxing playlist in hand can be a safe port. Many apps can help you balance your routine as well. 

Consider what you are doing right now. Is there anything that negatively impacts you? Can this habit be replaced? Or can it be reformed? How’s your sleeping schedule?
