        <p>Hello! I'm Luke Suffert, my major right now is Software Engineering. I am still figuring out what areas I want to work with when I graduate. But I really find softwares an interesting field.</p>
        <p>My hobbies are playing volleyball, playing video games, and hanging out with friends.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my whole life. My favorite scripture is 2 Nephi 1:15!</p>
